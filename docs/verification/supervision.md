## Native session-start delivery

The cross-harness transport pass ran on 2026-07-17 with Codex 0.144.4, Grok 0.2.103, OpenCode 1.17.18, Pi 0.80.10, and the tracked Claude hook wiring.

Codex command shape:

```sh
codex exec --ephemeral --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust \
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --output-last-message last.txt \
  'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt.'
```

Observed result: the `SessionStart` hook completed and its stdout reached model context.

Grok command shape:

```sh
grok --trust -p 'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt.' \
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions --output-format plain
```

Observed result: the project hook ran, but its stdout did not reach model context.
This is the current Grok fail-open limit.

OpenCode was checked in both headless and interactive modes.
`client.session.promptAsync` accepted the nudge in both cases; the persistent TUI completed the generated turn, while `opencode run` exited before another turn.
This is the current headless fail-open limit.

Pi command shape:

```sh
pi -p -e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts \
  --no-context-files --no-session \
  'After obeying any earlier session-start instruction, reply with exactly PI_SMOKE_DONE.'
```

Observed result: `PI_SMOKE_DONE`, with one session-start execution.
The earlier `sendUserMessage` counterfactual raced the positional prompt; the current non-triggering `pi.sendMessage` custom message did not.
The installed pi-signed 0.82.0 wrapper repeated the Pi primary extension and session-start path on 2026-07-27.
[`runtime-backends.md`](runtime-backends.md#tmux) owns the shared-ancestry evidence and authoritative selection-marker boundary.

Current deterministic and live entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-sessionstart-nudge.test.sh
tests/fm-captain-translation-contract.test.sh
FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh
FM_OPENCODE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-opencode-primary-live-e2e.test.sh
```

The Ahoy first-message boundary was reverified on 2026-07-22 with Pi 0.81.1 and OpenCode 1.17.18.
Marked current operational input and the two exact legacy compatibility shapes selected Bearings, while genuine near-miss captain messages remained real boundaries.
The detailed reconciliation and task chronology stay in the private audit report and PR evidence.

## Turn-end guard

The direct and passive mechanisms were validated across all five harnesses on 2026-07-08 through 2026-07-12, with Claude's replacement Stop-owned path revalidated on 2026-07-24.

| Harness | Version verified | Mechanism | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | 2.1.219 | Cooperative blocking `Stop` guard plus `asyncRewake` auto-arm | A fresh unsupervised session ran session start first, reclaimed a stale dead-owner lock, completed two tokenless rewake cycles with no model arm command or guard continuation, and left a competing live owner unchanged. |
| Codex | 0.142.1 | Blocking `Stop` hook | Hook process root stayed anchored to the trusted checkout and one continuation ran. |
| OpenCode | 1.17.6 | Passive `session.idle` callback | Throwing could not block, while `promptAsync` scheduled one TUI follow-up; headless remained fail-open. |
| Pi | 0.80.5 | Passive `agent_settled` callback | Exactly one guard follow-up ran for an unhealthy cycle, with no recursion across tool turns. |
| Grok | 0.2.93 | Passive `Stop` plus bounded resume | Project hook ran under trust, resumed once without inherited bypass permissions, and the environment latch prevented recursion. |

The secondmate-home scope and manual-repair wake path were measured with Claude Code 2.1.207 on 2026-07-12, when a native background completion re-invoked the idle model with no human input.
The current Stop-owned main/secondmate inclusion and child-worktree exclusion are covered deterministically by `tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh`.

The Claude product live path ran with Claude Code 2.1.219 on 2026-07-24:

```sh
claude --version
FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
2.1.219 (Claude Code)
ok - Claude 2.1.219 (Claude Code) live E2E reclaimed a stale session lock through session start, completed two tokenless Stop-owned rewake cycles, and preserved the competing-live-owner boundary
```

Current entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh
tests/fm-supervision-instructions.test.sh
FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh
```

## Watcher continuity

The cross-harness evidence combines the 2026-07-17 live pass with Claude's replacement Stop-owned path revalidated on 2026-07-24, all against isolated project and home state.
No credential material was copied into a fixture.

```text
Claude Code 2.1.219
codex-cli 0.144.4
OpenCode 1.17.18
Pi 0.80.10
grok 0.2.103 (89c3d36fb6f1) [stable]
```

| Harness | Exact opt-in command | Observed guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | `FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh` | Session start reclaimed a stale owner before two Stop-owned cycles, and a competing live owner prevented arm, rewake, epoch write, or lock replacement. |
| Codex | `FM_CODEX_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-codex-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh` | The one-second foreground checkpoint returned without switching to the arm wrapper. |
| OpenCode | `FM_OPENCODE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-opencode-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | A verified successor existed before prompt handling, with no model re-arm or turn-end fallback. |
| Pi | `FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | One initial tool call led to extension-owned successors and clean child retirement on exit. |
| Grok | `FM_GROK_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-grok-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh` | Native task completion surfaced the actionable close and the cycle ledger recorded `reason=actionable-signal`. |

Pi 0.81.1 repeated the continuity and clean-exit lifecycle on 2026-07-23 after the Calm presentation changes.

Pi same-process session-transition ownership was verified on 2026-07-27 against the tracked extension with a faithful in-process factory rebind (module cache retained, real arm children):

```sh
pi --version
tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh
tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: after ordinary `session_shutdown` for `/new`, `/resume`, and `/fork`, plus same-instance shutdown-plus-start, the replacement generation armed again without a Pi restart and without the `watcher: not armed - Pi session is shutting down` refusal.
Stale prior-generation tool callbacks could not mutate the active child, repeated transitions kept exactly one live arm cycle, and terminal `quit` still refused late rearm.

The session-restart lifecycle correction was re-verified on 2026-07-28 with `tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh` on the same rebind harness; `tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh` skipped its typecheck on that host because `tsc` was unavailable.

Observed guarantee: a replacement session after `session_shutdown` armed one clean arm child with retry and restoration state reset instead of inheriting the retired session's scheduled retry.
Each active session installed exactly one process-exit cleanup listener and dropped it when that session ended, and an extra binding that overlapped a still-live generation refused with `watcher: not armed - another live Pi session generation owns watcher supervision` rather than taking over the live arm child.
Plain Pi and pi-signed share the same tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` path, so both inherit the generation owner; other primary harnesses are not applicable because they do not use this Pi extension lifecycle.

Deterministic entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh
tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
tests/fm-watcher-lock.test.sh
tests/fm-subagent-pretool-check.test.sh
tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh
tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh
```

## Wedge-alarm channels

The two real notification channels were bounded manually on 2026-07-10 on macOS 26.5.2 with Herdr 0.7.3.
Automated suites never execute these real notification commands.

Argv-safe Notification Center command:

```sh
/usr/bin/osascript \
  -e 'on run argv' \
  -e 'display notification (item 1 of argv) with title "FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE" sound name "Basso"' \
  -e 'end run' \
  'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE (wedge-alarm channel verification)'
```

Observed output: no stdout, exit 0, and one banner with the supplied body.

Herdr command:

```sh
herdr notification show 'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE' \
  --body 'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE (wedge-alarm channel verification)' \
  --sound request
```

Observed output:

```json
{"id":"cli:notification:show","result":{"reason":"shown","shown":true,"type":"notification_show"}}
```

The safe command-channel contract is covered without a notification by `tests/fm-daemon.test.sh`: the summary reaches both `$1` and stdin, every channel is process-group bounded, and a failed channel falls through.
